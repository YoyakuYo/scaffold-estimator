# Always Commit & Push

After completing any coding task (new feature, bug fix, refactor, config change):

1. `git add` all relevant changed files
2. `git commit` with a concise message describing the change
3. `git push` to remote

Never end a task without committing and pushing. Do not ask — just do it automatically.
